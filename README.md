# GuessTheNumber
A game where you need to guess the number. Made in C#

# How to play
In order to play, you must have dotnet installed. You can go to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download to download. Once you have, create a new dotnet application by typing "dotnet new console" in the command prompt. When it creates those files, delete the "Program.cs" file and replace it with the file I have put above. To run, go to the place where you have placed the .cs file in terminal and run "dotnet run." If you do face any issues, please do say report it. 

# What is "Guess the Number."
It may seem like a childish, effortless small project I made but ngl, if you try it, it's actually fun as hell. The computer will think of a number and you need to guess what number it is. It might be from 0 - 50 or it might be from 0 - 1,000,000. To make it easier, the computer will tell you if the number you guessed is lower than the number the computer is thinking or higher. If you want, you can even turn the tables around and make it so that the computer guessses what number you're thinking!
